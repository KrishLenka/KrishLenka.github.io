Welcome to my portfolio.



**To-do:**
- Add comments (next to new css properties for understanding), especially to section out code. Helps with maintainability and understanding.

- Consider moving "profile" picture to top right or replace it completely

- Find out what to do about all that empty space between hero and projects section (add your niche/specialty) animate title carousel

Sidebar:
- When cursor hovers over one of the options in the sidebar, option should show pop-up animation + text has lighter gray background

- Header will be underlined with white border (similarly to how the sidebar has red border)
Sidebar will range from bottom of the viewing page up to the header (header is above sidebar in depth)

- Header and sidebar stays fixed on page.
- Should be able to scroll down to projects section from home page

Projects:
- "Projects" title/header will be left aligned (big white text just like in main page)
- Consider red line underlining it ranging from left edge to right edge (like header line)
- Red line is below side bar in depth
Keep 3-4 main projects

Project card:
- Initially outlined in 1px white border
- Thumbnail
- Title in bold font
- Date below that in red font
- Short description in thin white font
- When card is hovered over, card background becomes lighter gray (like when clicking options in sidebar)
- Clicking card will either open up pop-up or redirect to new page 

New project page/pop-up will have:
- Project title on top with white line underlined underneath from left edge to right edge
- Thumbnail is enlarged on the left (include clickable carousel of photos if possible)
- Github link to the right if available
- Demo link to the right if available
- Any other visitable links
Sections (scrollable): 
- Display list of skills, tools, technologies used (pill-style tags)
- Open-source or closed-source
- Description (drop down, expanded by default) - What, why, how + Technical details
- Inspiration (drop down, unexpanded)
- Accomplishments (drop down, unexpanded)
- Links/Sources (drop down, unexpanded) Note: may be a repeat of links above. May also have more links in case links did not fit. May include related links to sources used (such as links to datasets, links to tutorials, links to devpost, etc.) If too many links to list above, in red put a disclaimer *see links below* (down V arrow)

- If going with pop-up idea, keep an "x" on top left to go back to projects section/archive. Add a button on top right to redirect to new page (new pages help with SEO, organization, etc). Note: project header should be fixed (project title, "x" symbol on top left, redirect button)

- Below 3-4 main projects (in the projects section), have a curve-cornered horizontal button (white border, transparent background) labeled "Projects Archive" with a rotated arrow icon. When cursor hovers, have subtle hover fill. Consider arrow rotation animation on hover.

- Redirects to new page with all projects I've made and put on this website (Think of how you want user to go back to main page)

Experiences Section:
- This will be like a vertical timeline, ranging from most recent experience to oldest work experience (Columbia research project or quakerbridge)
Experiences considering to list: Video Compression Research project, Quakerbridge, Assignment Guru, CS112 Grader, Calculus 2 LA, Honeywell Internship
- Debating between two formats: 1) a vertical line down the middle with experiences panning left and right of the line or 2) line down the left side (or right side) only, divided by year.
- Either way, there will be bullet point descriptions of what I did at each experience.
- Ideas to make experience section more concise: Perhaps make experiences below most recent collapse under drop down. If my current experience/position lasts multiple years, I such truncate to "20xx-20xx". Recent past experience can be under a drop down like "20xx ^"
- And a much older experience (like high school, college experiences) can be under a drop down "show older experiences" or even removed entirely.

- Consider finding a landscape-sized photo to use as the cover image in the beginning (hero section will layer over it)

- ensure website is mobile/multi-platform friendly

Contact:
Include where you're currently based.
- LinkedIn
- Github
- Email: krishlenka2825 [at] gmail [dot] com
- Perhaps maybe a contact form
- Social media (Instagram or Twitter?)

Consider adding an animation before main page loads

- Expand website (include more than just work related portfolio content)
- Consider a now page: https://sive.rs/nowff
- Theme: Always learning, always growing (maybe have a blog-esque page where I share my journey learning new skills)
- New languages, new books
- Toggle between dark and light mode because why not
