Welcome to my portfolio.



**To-do:**
- Add comments (css)

- Consider moving "profile" picture to top right or replace it completely

- Find out what to do about all that empty space between hero and Projects section

Sidebar:
- When cursor hovers over one of the options in the sidebar, option should show pop-up animation + text has lighter gray background

- Header will be underlined with white border (similarly to how the sidebar has red border)
Sidebar will range from bottom of the viewing page up to the header (header is above sidebar in depth)

- animate title carousel

- Should be able to scroll down to projects section from home page
- Header and sidebar stays fixed on page.

- "Projects" title/header will be right aligned (big white text like name in main page)
- Consider red line underlining it ranging from left edge to right edge (like header line)
- Red line is below side bar in depth
Keep 3-4 main projects
Project card:
- Initially outlined in 1px white border
- Thumbnail
- Title in bold font
- Date below that in red font
- Short description in thin white font
- When card is hovered over, card background becomes lighter gray (like when clicking options in sidebar)
- Clicking card will either open up pop-up or redirect to new page 

New "page" will have:
- Project title on top with white line underlined underneath from left edge to right edge
- Thumbnail is enlarged on the left (include clickable carousel of photos if possible)
- Github link to the right if available
- Demo link to the right if available
- Any other visitable links
- Below display list of skills, tools, technologies used
- Sections:
- Description (drop down, unexpanded)
- Inspiration (drop down, unexpanded)
- Links/Sources (drop down, unexpanded) Note: may be a repeat of links above. May also have more links in case links did not fit. May include related links to sources used (such as links to datasets, links to tutorials, links to devpost, etc.) If too many links to list above, in red put a disclaimer *see links below* (down V arrow)

- If going with pop-up idea, keep an "x" on top left to go back to projects section/archive. Note: project header should be fixed (project title, "x" symbol on top left)

- Below 3-4 main projects (in the projects section), have a horizontal white button (curved corners) labeled "Projects Archive" with a rotated arrow icon. Keep white as slightly gray, when cursor hovers, button turns pure white.

- Redirects to new page with all projects I've made and put on this website (Think of how you want user to go back to main page)




Experiences Section:
- This will be like a vertical timeline, ranging from most recent experience to oldest work experience (Columbia research project or quakerbridge)
Experiences considering to list: Video Compression Research project, Quakerbridge, Assignment Guru, CS112 Grader, Calculus 2 LA, Honeywell Internship

- Consider finding a landscape-sized photo to use as the cover image in the beginning (hero section will layer over it)

- ensure website is mobile/multi-platform friendly
